# car-football-game-in-unity-engine
The game I made as a final year Engineering project inspired by rocket league. It has an .apk file for android as well as exe for PC. The project was supposed to demostrate use of cross-play between 2 different platforms by running a game on both platforms with comparable difficulty.
