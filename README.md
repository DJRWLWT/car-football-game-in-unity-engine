# Car football game in Unity 

The game I made as a final year Engineering project inspired by rocket league. It has an .apk file for android as well as an .exe for PC. The project was supposed to demostrate use of cross-play between 2 different platforms by running a game on both platforms with comparable difficulty.

It was made in Unity 5.4.2f and its incompatible with version 5.5

Just have to activate the touch controls for build of android and deactivate for PC.
